# Exploring Factors Influencing New York City Subway Ridership: A Machine Learning Approach
A project done for the Emerging Scholars Program at CUNY City Tech.

Abstract:
Increasing the subwayâ€™s capcity, comfort, and accessibility remains an ongoing goal for public transit agencies. Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York City (NYC) has chosen to deploy new open gangway subway cars on C line, aiming to improve the operation efficiency and service accessibility to seniors and people with disability. However, the impact of new car deployment has not been fully studied. This research proposes using Random Forest regressor to predict the daily ridership of all passengers, as well as senior and passengers with disability, separately on subway line C considering factors such as the day of the week, precipitation, weather conditions, and the deployment of new cars. Feature importance analysis will be conducted based on the fitted model to quantify the impact of new cars on the subway ridership. Linear regression will also be used as an alternative approach to evaluate the impact of the aforementioned factors on the ridership of different passenger groups. This study will provide insights to evaluating the effectiveness of the new open gangway cars in improving capacity and accessibility of New York City subway systems.
